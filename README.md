Vitt Vichaar is an online financial advisor tool for women entrepreneurs. Our idea behind this project to provide a one stop assistance to women who need finacial advices free of cost. We provide services such as prediction of closing price of a stock or a crypto so that they know where to invest and when to buy/sell a particular stock's share. We also provide all necessary information in the form of our precise and crisp blogs. We also provide a planner service in which users can add reminders of their premium installments in calendar.
